[setting-description-note]
note=Note: The "A" value represents the transparency (intensity) of the color. Although lower values appear darker in the color picker, that is just because they are being displayed on a dark background. In-game, lower "A" values will tend to look more pastel, while higher "A" values will look more rich and vibrant
