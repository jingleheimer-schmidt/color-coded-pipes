# Compatibility
This mod is generally compatible with all other mods, unless they remove the base game pipe, underground-pipe, pump, or storage-tank.
This mod includes hidden startup mod settings to define the colors of the rainbow colored pipes. Other mods may reveal or modify these as desired.

This mod will create color coded versions of the pipes from:
- [Pipe Plus](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/pipe_plus)
- [Flow Control](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Flow Control)
- [Storage Tank Mk2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/StorageTank2_2_0)

Honorable mentions for:
[No Pipe Touching](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/no-pipe-touching) if you want to place different color pipes directly next to each other
[Placeable Color Coded Pipes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/placeable-color-coded-pipes) if you want a textplates-like gui
