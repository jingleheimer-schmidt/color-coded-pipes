# Compatibility
This mod is generally compatible with all other mods, unless they remove the base game pipe, underground-pipe, pump, or storage-tank.
This mod includes hidden startup mod settings to define the colors of the rainbow colored pipes. Other mods may reveal or modify these as desired.
Honorable mention for [No Pipe Touching](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/no-pipe-touching) if you want to place different color pipes directly next to each other, and [Placeable Color Coded Pipes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/placeable-color-coded-pipes) if you want a textplates-like gui
